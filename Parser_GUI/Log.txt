Started by getting the run name to display from two pickers.
Once I have that filename, it's just a matter of feeding it through the rest of the code.
Copied Structs, LineHandlers with minimal fuss. BoxHandlers gave an error with the ellipsoid function
but I just put it inside the class and that got rid of the errors.
Same with Communicate. Everything works pretty well but I just put everything
into the one second pick event.

Instead, I'm going to have a confirm button which will then run all that stuff.
